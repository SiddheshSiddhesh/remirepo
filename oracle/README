One spec file per version / architecture, as upstream sometime release them
at different time, and content may also differ.


Differences with upstream packages:

- installation under /usr/lib64 instead of /usr/lib (x86_64)
- linker configuration to find the libraries
- some documentation (demo) in /usr/share/doc
- no version in package name, as parallel installation
  is not supported, so does not make sense
- auto provides/requires enabled
- rtsora not packaged (missing dependency on libcobcrtn64.so)
